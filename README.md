# GeckoMGV
Multigenome viewer in Django and JS - University of Málaga

## Installation

To run GeckoMGV on your computer you should install first some dependencies, starting with python and virtualenv, so:

* `apt-get install python virtualenv`
* `git clone https://github.com/Sergiodiaz53/GeckoMGV`

Then, I recommend to create a virtualenv for this project:

* `virtualenv GeckoMGV `

And activate it:

* `cd GeckoMGV/`
* `source bin/activate`

Now we should be working inside our virtualenv, so we are going to install django and its plugins

* pip install django==1.7.9 django-forms-builder==0.13.0 django_extensions==2.0.5

We are going to set Django up:

* `python manage.py migrate`
* `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Finally, we should be able to run GeckoMGV with:

* `python manage.py runserver`

*· You can modify the ip address and the port using `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`*

*· Installing Werkzeug (`pip install Werkzeug`) you can use `python manage.py runserver_plus` for debug details*
